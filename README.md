# Getting Started

This is just a Test-Project for Vue.js
The Code is not clean and there is much to improve

# Data
The data is fetched from [Countries-API](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all)

# Start
To start the project, run the following command:

```npm run dev```

# Positive
Easy to style, cool params like v-if and v-for similar to React-Components

# Negative
Need to list all Components in file, a lot of different methods to use
